          # Note: Vite vars are usually build-time.
          # For runtime config in Docker, we typically strictly rely on the build args or a runtime replacement script.
          # The Dockerfile likely uses build args.
          # If the user builds the image as per instructions, they should bake these in.
          # Here we can't easily change VITE_ vars at runtime unless the entrypoint supports it.
          # We'll assume the image is built with defaults or the user follows the plan to build it.
          # However, to be helpful, if the Dockerfile supports ENV override (some setups do), we provide them.
